class DirectoryCreator:
    """
        Creates a series of directories based on the input parameters.

        Args:
        - base_dir (str): The base directory in which
            the subdirectories will be created.
        - directories (list of tuples): A list of tuples where each
            tuple represents a subdirectory to create.
        The first element of each tuple is the name of the subdirectory,
            and the rest of the elements (if any)
        represent subdirectories within the previous directory.

        Example:
        base_dir = '/path/to/base'
        directories = [('logs',), ('logs', 'auth'), ('logs', 'core')]
        create_directories(base_dir, directories)

        This will create the following directories:
        - /path/to/base/logs
        - /path/to/base/logs/auth
        - /path/to/base/logs/core
